# Genomic Ranges Assignment

The Genomic\_Ranges\_Assignment contains two import files: mm10\_snp137\_chr1\_trunc.bed.gz (variant data) and the Mus\_musculus.GRC.m38.75\_chr1.gft.gz (chromosome 1 data.)

The outfile is titled chr1\_collapsed\_exons.csv that contains the seqnames, ranges, strand, and num_vars. 

The workflow is documented in genomic\_ranges\_assignment\_Rmarkdown.Rmd.
